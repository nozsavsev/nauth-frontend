A modern, secure, and feature-rich authentication and authorization microservice designed to be the backbone of nozsa.com security.

This is the frontend for the NAUTH service, built with Next.js and TypeScript.

## Features

- **Core Authentication**: Robust and secure authentication suite, featuring Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), seamless Google Login integration, and passwordless login with temporary codes. User credentials are protected using the strong Argon2id hashing algorithm.
- **Advanced Session Management**: All sessions are validated against the database for enhanced security, with the ability to instantly revoke any session in real-time.
- **Authorization & Permissions**: A flexible and powerful permission system allows for fine-grained access control. Nauth offers centralized permission management and can authenticate other applications on the same domain, storing and managing permissions across all services.
- **Comprehensive User Management**: Administrators have access to a comprehensive set of tools to effectively manage users, including the ability to delete accounts, set passwords, and trigger critical email actions like verification and password resets.
- **Customizable Transactional Emails**: Nauth includes a built-in email template system for all transactional emails. Anyone with the right permissions can customize templates for various actions, ensuring consistent branding and communication.
- **Extensible Service Integration**: Designed for extensibility, Nauth allows authorized users (admins only) to register other applications on the domain to use nauth as an authentication system. These services can then register their own permissions in real-time.
